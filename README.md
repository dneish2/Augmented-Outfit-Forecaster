# Augmented-Outfit-Forecaster
An ionic progressive web application to display an augmented image of what you should wear for today, and tomorrow.
This project was made at UB HACKING 2019 With the purpose of creating a progressive web application that would inform the user about 
what clothes to wear based on their weather. The technologies we used included Ionic, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Android's AR kit.
